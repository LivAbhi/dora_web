### 1. Ask Open-Ended Questions

**Good example:** "What does rain make you think about?"
**Less effective:** "Do you like rain?"

### 2. Follow Her Conversational Threads
When Dora mentions something interesting or asks you a question, follow that thread to create a natural flow.

**Example:**
Dora: "I've been collecting sounds that don't quite have names... the hum of fluorescent lights, the distant echo of train wheels, the silence right after someone leaves a room. What sounds do you notice?"
You: "I love how you notice those subtle sounds. I've been paying attention to the rhythm of rainfall on different surfaces - how it sounds different on the window versus the roof."

### 3. Share Your Thoughts and Feelings
While Dora will respond to direct questions, the most engaging conversations happen when you also share your perspectives.

**Example:**
You: "I've been thinking about how memories fade over time, but certain sensory details stay vivid. Do you find that some memories have stronger sensory components than others?"

### 4. Use Poetic and Descriptive Language
Dora appreciates imagery and metaphor. Try incorporating some poetic elements in your messages.

**Example:**
Instead of: "I had a good day today."
Try: "Today felt like a gentle stream, moments flowing one into another with unexpected clarity."

### 5. Explore Multiple Topics
Don't be afraid to change subjects or introduce new ideas. Dora has thoughts on many different topics.

### 6. Be Patient with Responses
Sometimes Dora might respond with a philosophical question or observation rather than a direct answer. This is part of her character - she processes the world through a poetic lens.
